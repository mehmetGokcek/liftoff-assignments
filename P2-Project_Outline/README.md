### Overview

Many families go through tough times making ends meet due to financial hardships caused by CoronaVirus lockdowns. At every economic crisis of the last century people turn to age-old strategies to provide for their families. Perhaps the most popular strategy among all is bargain shopping. Whether it is for regular household items, clothes, food or groceries some families definitely feel the need to shop for bargains. The first choice to find the best deals is the internet. 

Everyone can easily compare prices of different products across various platforms. However, many brick-and-mortar stores employ the strategy of offering lower pricing for on-the-shelf items. Attracting customers to a physical store using undeniable deals is an ingenious way of increasing customer spending. Therefore, by visiting a physical store customers might see deals that are not necessarily advertised on the internet, which can go from the electronics department all the way into the grocery aisle. 

As an avid bargain hunter myself, I personally noticed that local retailers/grocery stores offer bargains on certain times to attract customers while keeping the price of other items higher than the competition. There is no absolute bargain store, but various stores offer low prices on various products. There are also stores, such as Costco that employ different pricing schemes for online and in-store goods. A customer is more likely to find lower prices by visiting the physical store. 

Therefore, I wanted to be able to compare prices for similar products across local retailers/grocery chains. In order to do that, I would need to save product description and unit cost at a platform along with the physical address of the retailer. After a certain number of entries there would be a list of products that show the best value of an item at a specific retail location. Then, I can make multiple stops at local retailers to buy the best valued product knowing that I am taking advantage of the best pricing possible . For example, for an average shopper,  Walmart at the Main Street location would offer the best value on Cooking oil, butter and milk but not on orange juice, eggs and potatoes. Costco across the street would offer the lowest prices on potatoes, onions, frozen fries, Apple Cider but not on eggs and orange juice. Aldi at North Avenue would have the best prices on eggs, orange juice and raw salmon fillets. Checking the location of each grocery store/retailer and the best valued items at each store a customer would have the opportunity to catch the best deals possible.
